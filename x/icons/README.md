## Icons

This is a collection of icons from the (g)olden days of the X-GUI sites and desk modding. Majority of the icons are from GalaxyGUI and Macthemes. I have archived them for nostalgia. If you have an icon to add to the collection or if you want me to remove YOUR icon, please make a pull request. If you know the designer who created one of the icon, please contribute. I understand many of these icons were once NFR (haha). Enjoy!
